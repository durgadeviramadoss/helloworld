* The Azure Resource Manager (ARM or Azure RM) API is a JSON-driven REST API 
to provision and manage Azure cloud resources.
*  There is also a separate web portal, called the Azure Portal 
(formerly the “Ibiza Preview Portal“), 
which is used to provision Azure cloud resources using the Azure RM API.
 If you provision cloud resources using the “old” Azure Portal, 
 they are provisioned through the ASM API, and not the ARM API. 

1. ssh-rsa keys are required for any deployment using the Azure portal, regardless of the deployment model.
2. Azure requires ssh-rsa format key files of 2048 bits or the equivalent .pem files, depending upon your scenario.
3. If you already have such files, pass the public key file when creating your Azure VM.
4. Use ssh-keygen to create a 2048-bit RSA public and private key files, 
and unless you have a specific location or specific names for the files, 
accept the default location and name of ~/.ssh/id_rsa. The basic command is:
	#ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 
5. You can use ssh-rsa (.pub) keys for all new work, 
especially with the Resource Manager deployment model and the preview portal;
6. specially using Resource Manager deployments,
 pass the .pub file when prompted for an ssh key file path or the contents of a file as a string.
 option 1: create VM by passing ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to create vm
 eg :azure vm create \
--nic-name testnic \
--public-ip-name testpip \
--vnet-name testvnet \












http://timesheets.ascendlearning.com/ 
--vnet-subnet-name testsubnet \
--storage-account-name computeteststore 
--image-urn canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.3-LTS:latest \
--username ops \
-ssh-publickey-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
testrg testvm westeurope linux

option 2:ssh-rsa format with a Resource Manager template and the Azure CLI to create a  VM that 
is secured by a username and the contents of the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub as a string. 
azure group deployment create \
--resource-group test-sshtemplate \
--template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-vm-sshkey/azuredeploy.json \
--name mysshdeployment
